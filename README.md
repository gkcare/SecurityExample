# Spring Boot Security Example

This is a simple Spring Boot application demonstrating how to secure REST APIs using JWT-based authentication. The app allows users to log in with credentials and receive a token, which must be used to access protected endpoints.

## üîê Features

- JWT-based Authentication
- Login to receive a token
- Secure REST API endpoints with token validation
- MySQL database integration
- Environment-based key/secret for security

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- MySQL
- IntelliJ IDEA

## üß∞ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 17
- MySQL Server
- IntelliJ IDEA (or any preferred IDE)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-security-example.git
   cd spring-boot-security-example
````

2. **Configure the Application**

   In `src/main/resources/application.properties`, update the following properties:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_db
   spring.datasource.username=your_db_user
   spring.datasource.password=your_db_password

   jwt.secret=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```

3. **Create MySQL Database**

   Create a MySQL database named as configured above.

4. **Run the Application**

   You can run the application via your IDE or using the terminal:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

## üîë Usage

1. **Login**

   * Endpoint: `POST /login/login`
   * Body:

     ```json
     {
       "username": "user",
       "password": "password"
     }
     ```
   * Response: JWT Token

2. **Access Protected Endpoint**

   * Endpoint: `GET /*****`
   * Header:

     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
     ```

## üì¶ Use Case

This project can be used as a boilerplate for any feature requiring secure access via REST APIs in a Spring Boot application.

Feel free to replace placeholders like `your-username`, database credentials, or endpoint paths with your actual values. Would you like me to add a sample curl command for login or API testing?
